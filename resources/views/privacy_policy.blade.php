                        http://www.google.com. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate the use of our Website and
                        Services and for analysis and statistical purposes. We use these tools to help us improve our

                        online activities tracked. This is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a
                        "do not track" feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for
                        how companies should respond to "do not track" signals, although one may develop in the future. We
                        do not respond to "do not track" requests or signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we
                        will describe how in this Policy.</p>
